## Email Verification URL with Purpose Implementation

### Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented the purpose-based verification URL system as requested. Here's what was changed:

### ðŸ”§ **Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Dynamic Verification Route**
- **Created**: `/src/app/verification/[purpose]/page.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles dynamic verification URLs like `/verification/email`
- **Features**: 
  - Maps URL parameters to enum values (`email` â†’ `EMAIL_VERIFICATION`)
  - Supports multiple purposes: `email`, `forgot-password`, `update-password`
  - Passes the correct purpose to the verification component

#### 2. **Updated Sign-in Flow**
- **File**: `/src/views/sign-in/index.jsx`
- **Change**: Redirects to `/verification/email` instead of `/verification`
- **Purpose**: Users with unverified emails now go to the purpose-specific URL

#### 3. **Enhanced Verification Component**
- **File**: `/src/views/verification/index.jsx`
- **New Features**:
  - Purpose-specific content (titles, descriptions, success messages)
  - Dynamic content based on `getOtpPurposeOptions()`
  - Improved success handling for route-based usage
  - Auto-update of user verification status

#### 4. **Streamlined AuthProvider**
- **File**: `/src/helper/AuthProvider.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Redirects to `/verification/email` instead of showing modal
  - Removed unused modal logic and state
  - Cleaner, more focused authentication flow

### ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose-Specific Content:**

#### Email Verification (`/verification/email`)
- **Title**: "Verify Your Email"
- **Get OTP**: "We will send a 6-character verification code to your registered email address..."
- **Verify**: "We have sent a 6-character verification code to your email address. Please enter it below to verify your account."

#### Forgot Password (`/verification/forgot-password`)
- **Title**: "Reset Your Password"
- **Get OTP**: "...receive your password reset code..."
- **Verify**: "...enter it below to reset your password."

#### Update Password (`/verification/update-password`)
- **Title**: "Update Your Password"
- **Get OTP**: "...receive your verification code..."
- **Verify**: "...enter it below to update your password."

### ðŸ”„ **User Flow:**

1. **User logs in** with unverified email
2. **Automatically redirected** to `/verification/email`
3. **Purpose-specific content** is displayed based on the URL
4. **Email verification process** proceeds normally
5. **Upon success**, user is redirected to dashboard
6. **Future usage** can support other purposes like password reset

### ðŸ›  **Technical Benefits:**

- âœ… **SEO-friendly URLs** with clear purpose indication
- âœ… **Shareable verification links** for different purposes
- âœ… **Modular design** supporting multiple verification types
- âœ… **Backward compatibility** with existing verification logic
- âœ… **Consistent enum usage** from `getOtpPurposeOptions()`
- âœ… **Clean routing** with Next.js dynamic routes

### ðŸ“± **Usage Examples:**

```javascript
// Email verification after login
router.push('/verification/email');

// Password reset flow
router.push('/verification/forgot-password');

// Password update flow
router.push('/verification/update-password');
```

All changes maintain backward compatibility while providing the new purpose-based URL structure as requested. The verification component now dynamically adapts its content based on the purpose parameter from the URL.
